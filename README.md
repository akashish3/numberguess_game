# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows users to guess a number and see if it matches the randomly generated number by the computer.

## Features

- Input field for users to enter their guess.
- Button to submit the guess.
- Random number generation by the computer.
- Feedback on whether the guessed number is correct, too high, or too low.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Enter your guess in the input field.
3. Click the "Let's go" button to submit your guess.
4. An alert message will guide you if you need to guess a higher or lower number.
5. If you guess correctly, a message will be displayed indicating you have won.

## Code Overview

### HTML Structure

The HTML file includes the following key elements:

- A `div` container to center the game on the page.
- A `div` box containing the game elements, including a heading, input field, button, and result message.

### CSS Styling

The CSS code styles the game elements, including:

- Centering the game on the page using flexbox.
- Setting background colors and hover effects for input fields and buttons.
- Styling headings and paragraphs to improve readability.

### JavaScript Logic

The JavaScript code handles the game logic, including:

- Randomly generating a number between 0 and 9.
- Comparing the user's guess with the random number.
- Displaying the result using alert messages and updating the page with a message if the guess is correct.

## Future Improvements

- Add more levels with increasing difficulty.
- Implement a scoring system to keep track of the player's attempts.
- Enhance the design with more advanced styling and animations.

## Files
